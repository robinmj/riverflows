        Welcome to RiverFlows 2.0!

        It is now possible to save "destinations" on the my.riverflowsapp.com server.

        This makes it possible for you to specify more information about your favorite gages including a custom name, description, and preferred level ranges.

        Also, since destinations are stored remotely, they can be backed up and synchronized across devices.

        To get started please log in using your Google Account
